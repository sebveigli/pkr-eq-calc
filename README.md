Poker Equity Calculator

This was a project written by me back in 2017.

JavaFX powers the UI, however the main functionality is behind that.

You are able to compare head-to-head the probability of 2 poker hands against each other and see the probability of each winning.

The application allows you to also select hand ranges, rather than just a specific hand, to test a wider set of hands. The flop, turn and river runouts are also customizable.
